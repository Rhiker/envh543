This document offers a probabilistic solution in R for the daily microbial 
exposure from drinking water consumption, swimming in surface water and 
shellfish consumption for 
[Example 6.18](https://books.google.com/books?id=ejTKAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT265&ots=6q9TSELe3B&pg=PT265#v=onepage&q&f=false) from pages 215-216 of:

[Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment, 2nd Edition](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118145291,subjectCd-CH20.html) 
by Charles N. Haas, Joan B. Rose, and Charles P. Gerba. (Wiley, 2014).
