### Quantitative microbial risk assessment

Provides the latest QMRA methodologies to determine infection risk cause
by either accidental microbial infections or deliberate infections
caused by terrorism

-   Reviews the latest methodologies to quantify at every step of the
    microbial exposure pathways, from the first release of a pathogen to
    the actual human infection
-   Provides techniques on how to gather information, on how each
    microorganism moves through the environment, how to determine their
    survival rates on various media, and how people are exposed to the
    microorganism
-   Explains how QMRA can be used as a tool to measure the impact of
    interventions and identify the best policies and practices to
    protect public health and safety
-   Includes new information on genetic methods
-   Techniques use to develop risk models for drinking water,
    groundwater, recreational water, food and pathogens in the indoor
    environment

### EnvStats

-   EnvStats is a comprehensive R software library for environmental
    scientists, engineers, and regulators, based on the open-source
    statistics and graphics package R.
-   This book shows how to use EnvStats to easily produce powerful
    graphical and statistical analyses of environmental data.
-   Includes extensive
    [examples](http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/library/EnvStats/scripts/Manual/)
    using data sets from [regulatory guidance
    documents](https://www3.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/correctiveaction/resources/guidance/sitechar/gwstats/unified-guid.pdf).

### R for Stata Users

- This book shows you how to extend the power of Stata through the
  use of R.
- It introduces R using Stata terminology with which you are
  already familiar.
- It steps through more than 30 programs written in both languages,
  comparing and contrasting the two packages’ different approaches.
- When finished, you will be able to use R in conjunction with
  Stata, or separately, to import data, manage and transform it,
  create publication quality graphics, and perform basic statistical
  analyses.

- An example-based introduction to the R statistical computing
  environment
- Does not assume any previous familiarity with R or other software
  packages
- R functions are presented in the context of interesting
  applications with real data
