### Quantitative microbial risk assessment

Provides the latest QMRA methodologies to determine infection risk cause by 
either accidental microbial infections or deliberate infections caused by terrorism

- Reviews the latest methodologies to quantify at every step of the microbial
exposure pathways, from the first release of a pathogen to the actual human
infection
- Provides techniques on how to  gather information, on how each microorganism 
moves through the environment, how to determine their survival rates on various
media, and how people are exposed to the microorganism
- Explains how QMRA can be used as a tool to measure the impact of interventions 
and identify the best policies and practices to protect public health and safety
- Includes new information on genetic methods
- Techniques use to develop risk models for drinking water, groundwater, 
recreational water, food and pathogens in the indoor environment
